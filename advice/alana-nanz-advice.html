                <h4>Stay motivated and don't give up.</h4>
                <p>Learning to code is like learning a new language. It's hard work and will take determination and dedication.</p>

                <p>When you are feeling stuck or overwhelmed, don't give up! You've made the choice to switch to a career in tech for a reason. Always keep your end goal in sight.</p>

                <h4>You are smart!</h4>
                <p>You can do this. You can learn to code.
                </p>

                <p>Someday you'll look back and wonder why you didn't make the jump sooner.</p>
